
h1. Description

The goal of this project is to create two way converter - from FIX -> FIXML and from FIXML -> FIX. On the FIX side I depends on "QuickFIX/J":http://www.quickfixj.org solution. On the FIXML side I try to parse schema files and construct proper XML with "XStream":http://xstream.codehaus.org converters from Codehause.

h1. Work In Progress

For now only simple messages can be converted into XML. Any *help* is greatly *appreciated*.

h1. TODO

* Marshal repeating groups
* Whole unmarshalling stuff (this will be hard)
